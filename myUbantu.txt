#And I want to  write some content for setup SSH and clone github.

1.checking for existing SSH keys
    before you generate an SSH key, you can check to see if you have any existing SSH keys.
    1>.Open Terminal.
    2>.Enter 'ls -al ~/.ssh' to see if existing SSH keys are present
    3>.Check the directory list to see if you already have a public SSH key.

    By default,the filenames of the pubilc keys are one of the following:
    
    >id_dsa.pub
    >id_ecdsa.pub
    >id_ed25519.pub
    >id_rsa.pub
    >if you don't have an existing public and private key pair,or don't
